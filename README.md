# OpmlJsonFlattener
This extracts all the feeds from an opml file and convert to flat json. I created this because my liferea feed list was becoming long and had many folders, but I wanted a flat JSON export of the feeds.

run npm install (xml-parser is the only dependency)

<pre><code>node index.js filename.opml</code></pre>

the output is an json file in the same folder
